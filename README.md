 - I apologize I am not able to turn in an actual project, Professor. I am just turning in the license and readme because I am currently slammmed with other final projects as well. I appreciate your understanding on behalf of myself and my other classmates. You were a joy to learn from and I appreciate everything you taught me as well as how understanding you have been. Thank you for a great semester and good luck with what comes ahead.
